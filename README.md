# DeliveryBees
This is a project which aims to have an effective delivery system where users can use the web platform to access a number of dispatch riders that are available to make
deliveries for the customers from wherever they ordered goods from.

The repository consists of the SQL file, php files and others to ensure a seamless connection when interacting with the webpages.
